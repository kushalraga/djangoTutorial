        <h2>Django and the MVT Architecture</h2>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. Here's a brief overview:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Handles the data logic. It interacts with the database to manage and retrieve data.</li>
            <li><strong>View:</strong> Contains the application's logic. It receives requests from the user, interacts with the Model to get the necessary data, and then passes that data to the Template.</li>
            <li><strong>Template:</strong> A presentation layer that defines how the data will be displayed to the user. It uses placeholders to dynamically insert data passed by the View.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This separation of concerns makes the development process more organized and maintainable.</p>
